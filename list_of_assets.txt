This file has a list of assets used in this project. All assets are publicly available on Google Earth Engine, and each asset is listed with 
the file path that can be used for import (e.g. var Good_Thiessens = 
ee.FeatureCollection(“projects/arctic-carbon/assets/Good_Thiessens_3”)). Not all assets are used in all files, but all assets listed 
here are used in at least one file.
