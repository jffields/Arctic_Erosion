This file has a list of assets used in this project. Each asset is listed with the file path that can be used for import
(e.g. var Good_Thiessens = ee.FeatureCollection(“users/jordanffieldsgr/ArcticCarbon/Good_Thiessens_3”)) and a link to view
the asset in the Earth Engine code editor, where appropriate. Not all assets are used in all files, but all assets listed here are used in
at least one file.
